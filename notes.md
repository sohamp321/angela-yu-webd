# FLEXBOX

- For align items to work, you need to have a height property
- won't work if flex-wrap is set to wrap
- `align-content` is similar to `align-items` but only works when you have set the `flex-wrap : wrap;`
- max-width/max-height> flex-basis > width > content width

# Grid

## grid-template-area

- give each item a value of `grid-area: itemNo` and then create a grid from dots in grid-template-area and position them
